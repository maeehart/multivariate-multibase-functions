# Multivariate multibase functions

This project aims at producing functions which are represented as weighted sums of other so-called base functions. The idea of the project is to create tools which can be used in machine learning and other similar applications.

## Getting Started

The class of functions is intended to be included in the project directory and to be imported from there. There exists a Usage.ipynb Jupyter Notebook which shows examples how to use the project.

### Prerequisites

Project requires Python 3 with numpy and scipy.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome.
